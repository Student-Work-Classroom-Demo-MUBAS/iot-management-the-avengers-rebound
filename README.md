## üéØ PROJECT OVERVIEW

### **Mission**
Design and develop a complete **IoT Data Management System** that connects physical sensors with a web-based dashboard and provides secure APIs for external access.

This project simulates real-world IoT applications such as smart cities, industrial monitoring, agriculture, and environmental sensing.

### **Learning Objectives**
By completing this project, you will:
- Design and implement an IoT data pipeline end-to-end.
- Build secure, scalable Node.js + Express web applications.
- Create RESTful APIs with authentication and authorization.
- Use Swagger to document and test APIs.
- Develop responsive dashboards with HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, and EJS.
- Apply best practices in security, testing, Git usage, and teamwork.

## üìä PROJECT COMPONENTS & MARKS

### **1. IoT Device Development (20 marks)**
- Connect minimum 3 sensors.  
- Collect, process, and transmit data with device ID & timestamp.  
- Implement error handling and reconnection logic.  

### **2. Backend Development (25 marks)**
- Express.js server with modular routes.  
- Database schema for devices, users, and sensor readings.  
- CRUD APIs for devices and data.  
- Authentication & authorization with JWT/sessions + API keys.  
- Secure coding: prevent SQL injection, validate inputs, sanitize outputs.  

### **3. Frontend Development (15 marks)**
- Dashboard with navigation (EJS templates).  
- Real-time sensor readings (AJAX / polling).  
- Historical charts (Chart.js).  
- Device management (add/remove/list devices).  
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop.  

### **4. API Documentation with Swagger (10 marks)**
- Interactive API docs at `/api-docs`.  
- All endpoints documented with parameters and response examples.  
- Authentication requirements clearly shown.  

**Swagger Explanation**  
Swagger (also called **OpenAPI**) is a tool to describe and test APIs in a visual format.  
- Students must integrate Swagger UI so that visiting `/api-docs` shows a list of available endpoints.  
- Example snippet for devices API:

```yaml
paths:
  /api/devices:
    get:
      summary: Get all registered devices
      responses:
        "200":
          description: A list of devices
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: "#/components/schemas/Device"
components:
  schemas:
    Device:
      type: object
      properties:
        device_id:
          type: string
        device_name:
          type: string
        location:
          type: string
```

### **5. Integration & Testing (10 marks)**
- Verify full pipeline: IoT device ‚Üí API ‚Üí database ‚Üí dashboard.  
- API tested with Postman & Swagger.  
- Security testing: authentication, authorization, input validation.  

### **6. Documentation (5 marks)**
- **README.md** with setup instructions.  
- Technical documentation (architecture diagram, database schema, API list).  
- User manual with screenshots.  

### **7. Collaboration & Git Usage (5 marks)**
- Shared GitHub repo with meaningful commits from all members.  
- Feature branches, proper commit messages, pull requests where possible.  
- Repo structured professionally.  

### **8. Demo & Viva (20 marks)**
- 20-minute live demonstration of IoT device, APIs, and dashboard.  
- Show API usage via Swagger or Postman.  
- Q\&A session: each member must present part of the work.  
- Depth of understanding and clarity of explanation will be strongly weighted.
